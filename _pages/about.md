Hello World!
I am currently a second-year M.S. student (with thesis) in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am a member of [iDEA-iSAIL Lab](https://www.idea-isail.com/index.html), advised by [Prof. Jingrui He](https://www.hejingrui.org/). Prior to this, I earned my B.S. with highest honors in Computer Engineering at UIUC. I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Mengdi Wang](https://mwang.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, and [Prof. James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) at Stanford University. Currently, I am a student researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I also held research internships at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) before.  

My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing, with a specific focus on **LLMs Reasoning**. My research interests include:
- **Agentic AI**, including single/multi-agent systems with tool integration, reward modeling, and test-time scaling.
- **Data-centric Learning**, including structure (e.g., graph, table)/multimodal (e.g., image) data representation learning, data selection and pruning.
- **Scientic Foundation Models**, including AI for X (weather forecasting, agriculture, clinic discovery, etc.), and science paper agents.

Feel free to email me if you are interested in my research and would like to discuss related topics or potential collaborations.

ðŸ“Œ <span style="color:red">I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in Fall 2026. If there is a good fit, please feel free to reach out to me through email at jiaruz2 [at] illinois [dot] edu!</span>
